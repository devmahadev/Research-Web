**Abstract** 
Modern financial systems have grown to the scale of global geographic distribution and latency requirements are measured in
nanoseconds. Low-latency systems where reaction time is primary success factor and design consideration, are serious challenge to existing integration
and system level testing techniques. While existing tools support prescribed input profiles they seldom provide enough reactivity to run the
tests with simultaneous and interdependent input profiles at remote frontends. Additional complexities emerge due to severe timing constraints
the tests have to meet when test navigation decision time ranges near the message propagation time. Sufficient timing conditions for remote online
testing have been proven by Larsen et al. and implemented in Δ-testing method recently. We extend the Δ-testing by deploying testers on fully
distributed test architecture. This approach reduces the test reaction time by almost a factor of two. We validate the method on a distributed
time-sensitive global financial system case study.
