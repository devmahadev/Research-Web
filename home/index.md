I came to Estonia as a master’s exchange student in 2013 under the `Erasmus Mundus` `Heritage Scholarship`. Currently, I am a `Researcher` at Department of Computer Science, [Tallinn University of Technology](http://www.ttu.ee/doktorandile) and `Software Engineer` at [Elvior Ltd](http://www.elvior.com/).

 
### Research Assistant
My research is in `time-efficient algorithms` and `verification` for distributing systems, and, more broadly, in all means and methods that help designing correct and reliable systems. I work on algorithms and theory for generating tests for distributing systems by exploiting model based techniques. The main objectives of my research is to develop a model based distributed testing methodology, a framework with a pool of related formal methods that support distributed testing with both centralized and decentralized control up to fully distributed coordination of test components. The key task of the research and novelty lies in the elaboration of - Fully automated test generation technique for distributed on-line testing and its implementation in the form of time-efficient algorithms.

### Software Engineer
Parallel with my PhD I also work as a Software Engineer at Elvior. Major work comprises development of Model Based Testing tools such as Test Cast MBT, Implementation of Algorithm (based on our publication) for generating optimal test cases with model checker (specially DIVINE) and of course writing quality code.

**Specialization:** I am specializing in model-based testing of real-time systems. My current interest is exploiting the Divine and Uppaal model-checker in testing. You must know my dear supervisors: [Prof. Jüri Vain](https://www.etis.ee/Portal/Persons/Display/0162fc67-4c10-4477-8a60-dae14775e332).
