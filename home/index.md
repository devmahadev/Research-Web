I am an Indian citizen living in Tallinn, I came to Estonia as a master’s exchange student in 2013 under the Erasmus Mundus Heritage Scholarship. 
Currently, I am a researcher at Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia and Software Engineer at http://www.elvior.com/.

## Work Experience:

### Elvior Ltd. (http://www.elvior.com/)
Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer with Elvior parallel with my PhD. Major work comprises development of Model Based Testing tools such as Test Cast MBT, Implementation of Algorithm (based on our publication) for generating optimal test cases with model checker (specially DIVINE) and of course writing quality code.  


### EXCS (Estonian eXcellence in Computer Science) 
I worked as a Junior Research Scientist on this project and the main objectives of this research was to develop a model based distributed testing methodology, a framework with a pool of related formal methods that support distributed testing with both centralized and decentralized control up to fully distributed coordination of test components. The key task of the research and novelty lies in the elaboration of - Fully automated test generation technique for distributed on-line testing and its implementation in the form of time-efficient algorithms.	

### Eliko Technology  (http://www.eliko.ee)                                                       (Jan – June) 2014
 Profile: Software Engineer
         My work at Eliko Tech. was one of the modules of master’s thesis work, which is on model based conformance testing, writing model, implemented automated test cases using  J-Unit frameworks, Selenium and also formal analysis using model checking.

**Pro-tip:** I am specializing in model-based testing of real-time systems. My current interest is exploiting the Divine and Uppaal model-checker in testing. You must know my dear supervisors: Prof. Jüri Vain.
